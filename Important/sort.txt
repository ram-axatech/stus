Binary search = divided into two part and find last value to compary (     int m = l + (r-l)/2;
 
    // Check if x is present at mid
    if (arr[m] == x) 
        return m;  
 
    // If x greater, ignore left half  
    if (arr[m] < x) 
        l = m + 1; 
 
    // If x is smaller, ignore right half 
    else
         r = m - 1; )
