1. Advantage of anonymous functions
	a. Not reusability
	b. Private Funcationality
	c. If no name is needed because the function is only ever called in one place, then why add a name to whatever namespace you're in.
	d. Anonymous functions are declared inline and inline functions have advantages in that they can access variables in the parent scopes. Yes, you can put a name on an anonymous function, but that's usually pointless if it's declared inline. So inline has a significant advantage and if you're doing inline, there's little reason to put a name on it.
	e. The code seems more self-contained and readable when handlers are defined right inside the code that's calling them. You can read the code in almost sequential fashion rather than having to go find the function with that name.
